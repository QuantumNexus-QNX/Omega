# Consciousness Modeling Integration TODO

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Clone and examine Omega repository structure
- [x] Understand existing app routes (/spectral, /spectral-wasm, /trilogic, /console)
- [x] Identify dark cosmic theme requirements
- [x] Review existing components for reuse

## Code Adaptation
- [x] Copy math libraries from trivector-omega to Omega/app/lib
- [x] Adapt components to match dark cosmic theme
- [x] Update color scheme from light to dark
- [x] Integrate with existing Omega layout and navigation

## Route Creation
- [x] Create /app/consciousness route for main hub
- [x] Integrate spectral pages with existing /spectral routes
- [x] Enhance /trilogic with new features
- [x] Enhance /console with ENCHC framework
- [x] Add JO tensor calculus section

## Navigation Integration
- [x] Update main page.tsx to include consciousness modeling
- [x] Add navigation links to new sections
- [x] Ensure consistent routing across all pages

## Testing
- [x] Test all spectral computations
- [x] Test tri-logic visualizations
- [x] Test console parameter controls
- [x] Verify dark theme consistency
- [x] Test responsive design

## Documentation
- [x] Update README with new features
- [x] Document consciousness modeling architecture
- [x] Create integration guide
